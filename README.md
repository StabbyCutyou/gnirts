GNIRTS
#########

Package gnirts was inspired by [this twitter comment](https://twitter.com/casio_juarez/status/921033719435218950)

It's a simple set of benchmarks to show the many different (and occasionally incorrect) ways to reverse a string.

Go lacks a built in method for string reversal, leaving people to just do it themselves.

This leads to different implementations which don't always work for all cases. For example, many of the methods in this library will not work with combination-characters in Unicode. Follow the links to see the original place they came from - the fastest result is not always the most correct one.

It's meant as a benchmark repository just to show the different ways you could do it, and what the tradeoffs are.
